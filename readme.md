11 Feb 97 - You may now specify a file to log your reading to. It's just as ugly as the output to the screen,
but it gives you a way to record your session. Thanks to Canis for suggesting it.

Note that there appears to be a bug with respect to running under DOSBOX, you may have to press CONTROL-Enter instead of just enter to enter lines. If the y/N prompt at the beginning never continues, try that.

It's shipped here for MSDOS, but it should build under anything that can read the K&R C syntax it's presented in. Building in a newer compiler will probably fix the above-mentioned DOSBOX incompatibility, too.
