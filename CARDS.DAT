TAROT DECK v2.0 by Mike Ward. For entertainment purposes only.

Introduction
------------
Tarot cards have existed in one form or another for hundreds of
years. The deck contains 78 cards, divided into two groups, or
ARCANA. The Major Arcana contains 22 cards, and are numbered 0-22
(card 0, the fool, is often not numbered at all.) These are the
major cards, the "trumps", and have generally stronger meanings
than those of the minor arcana.

The Minor Arcana contains 56 cards, made up of four suits. They are
the swords, wands, cups, and pentacles (sometimes called coins.)

This program attempts to read the cards by outlining a very basic
layout,and presenting generalized meanings for the cards. No
attempt is made to interpret the proximity of certain cards, for
there are too many combinations to try to account for. You should
try to apply to general meanings presented to the subject in
question to gain a deeper insight into what the cards are trying to
say.

Remember, the Tarot are not meant as a window into a certain
future, but rather a mirror that reflects where you are going,
should you stay on the path you currently take. They are meant to
induce thought regarding your choices, not to run your life for
you.

The reading the program attempts for you is known as the Celtic
Cross. First a card is chosen to represent you, based on your age,
sex, and temperament. Then 10 cards are drawn, each reflecting a
different element of the subject, and leading up towards a
generalized answer. It is up to you to make the proper
interpretation -- a computer is not up to the task.
